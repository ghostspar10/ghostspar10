  Hi, my name is Timothy Schultz, and I'm an aspiring programmer and game developer. I don't have much professional experience at the moment, 
but I'm seeking to improve my code and get experience constantly! I have experience with Unity and VR development, as well as some both front
and back end web design with AWS/Firebase.
